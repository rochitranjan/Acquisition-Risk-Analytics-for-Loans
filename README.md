Problem Statement
About Company
Smansha Home Finance deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

Problem
Smansha wants you to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. You need to develop a state of the art model which would help Smansha filtering out the bad cases so that overall default rate remains lower.

You need to create a jupyter notebook or html file where all the steps and methodologies you have used should be shown. Python language is mandatory for this assignment.
The details provided by Smansha are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.
